MKCL

* Building

  On a relatively fresh Linux this should do:

  cd mkcl
  ./configure
  make

** Dependencies

  MKCL requires the platform supplied GMP library (>= 4.3.2), and GMP
  development files when compiling MKCL from its sources.

  On Debian based systems you can install it using:

  sudo apt-get install libgmp-dev

* Installing

  You can "install" MKCL locally into the source directory by:

  cd mkcl/src
  make install-local

  Once it's done you can use the ./mkcl/src/bin/mkcl executable to
  start MKCL, either directly or through a symlink. You may want to
  use 'rlwrap mkcl' to enable line editing.

  If you so prefer then you can install MKCL using 'make install'
  under the filesystem prefix given to the configure script (it
  defaults to '/usr/local').
