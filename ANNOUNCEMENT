Announcement of MKCL version 1.0.0
==================================

This is ManKai Common Lisp (MKCL).

MKCL finds its origin in the source code of the ECL project and thus shares
a lot of features with ECL. MKCL, as ECL before it, aims to produce an implementation of
the Common Lisp language which complies to the ANSI X3J13 Common Lisp standard,
but in a more contained and controlled context.

MKCL strives for greater reliability and stability in a quest for the ease of use
that thus result. Over abundance of features and reckless search of performance
are avoided in MKCL.

MKCL supports the operating systems Linux and Microsoft Windows, running
on top of Intel x86 or AMD64 compatible processors.

MKCL is a multi-threaded only implementation.



Notes for this release
======================

This release is the first one of MKCL, it includes an entirely new
architecture for signal handling that we hope will improve very
significantly the overall robustness of the whole MKCL system.



Known issues:

None reported at this moment.
