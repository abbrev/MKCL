.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
MKCL stands for ManKai Common Lisp.
MKCL implements an environment that strives
to comply with the X3J13 ANSI Common Lisp standard.
.PP
The current MKCL implementation features:
.IP \(bu
A bytecode compiler and interpreter.
.IP \(bu
A translator to C.
.IP \(bu
An interface to foreign functions.
.IP \(bu
A dynamic loader.
.IP \(bu
The possibility to build standalone executables.
.IP \(bu
The Common-Lisp Object System (CLOS).
.IP \(bu
Conditions and restarts for handling errors.
.IP \(bu
Sockets as ordinary streams.
.IP \(bu
The Gnu Multiprecision library for fast bignum operations.
.IP \(bu
A simple conservative mark & sweep garbage collector.
.IP \(bu
The Boehm-Weiser garbage collector.

.PP
\fBmkcl\fP without any argument gives you the
interactive lisp.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 1i
.BI \-shell " file"
Executes the given file and exits, without providing a read-eval-print loop.
If you want to use lisp as a scripting language, you can write
.BR "#!@bindir@/mkcl -shell"
on the first line of the file to be executed, and then MKCL will be
automatically invoked.
.TP
.B \-norc
Do not try to load the file
.I ~/.mkclrc
at startup.
.TP
.B \-dir
Use
.I dir
as system directory.
.TP
.BI \-load " file"
Loads
.I file
before entering the read-eval-print loop.
.TP
.BI \-eval " expr"
Evaluates
.I expr
before entering the read-eval-print loop.
.TP
.BI \-compile " file"
Translates
.I file
to C and invokes the local C compiler to produce a 
shared library with .fas as extension per default.
.TP
.BI \-o " ofile"
When compiling
.I file
name the resulting shared library
\fIofile\fP.
.TP
.BI \-c " cfile"
When compiling name the intermediary C file
.I cfile
and do not delete it afterwards.
.TP
.BI \-h " hfile"
When compiling name the intermediary C header
.I hfile
and do not delete it afterwards.
.TP
.BI \-data " [datafile]"
Dumps compiler data into \fIdatafile\fP or, if not
supplied, into a file named after the source file, but
with .data as extension.
.TP
.B \-s
Produce a linkable object file. It cannot be loaded 
with load, but it can be used to build libraries 
or standalone executable programs. 
.TP
.B \-q
Produce less notes when compiling.

.PP
The options
.B \-load,
.B \-shell,
and
.B \-eval
may appear any number of times, and they are combined and processed from left
to right.
.SH AUTHORS
MKCL was forked from ECL 9.6.2 by Jean-Claude Beaudoin, who currently maintains it.

The original version of ECL was developed by Giuseppe Attardi starting from the Kyoto
Common Lisp implementation by Taiichi Yuasa and Masami Hagiya.  ECL was later taken
over and further developed by Juan Jose Garcia Ripoll.
.SH FILES
.TP
.BR "~/.mkcl, ~/.mkclrc"
Default initialization files loaded at startup unless the option
.BR \-norc
is provided.
(if they exist).
